        "Terragrids is building a new concept for funding renewable energy projects at scale. Rather than relying on single individuals to foot the bill, Terragrids seeks to spread the financial investment across the globe. The Terragrids platform provides an online gamified experience for Backers to invest as little as $10 to buy Non-Fungible Tokens on the energy-efficient Algorand blockchain and build their sustainable towns and communities in the metaverse. Revenues from the sales are placed in a Terragrids treasury Algo crypto-wallet, that everyone can see. A small part of this money is used to sustain the business, while most of the revenue is used to fund Creators' renewable energy projects.",

        'Terragrids is being set up as a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO). Backers holding at least one NFT can be part of the DAO governing body, monitoring and contributing to its operations. They can also see in detail how their purchase of NFTs in the metaverse directly financed real assets on the ground, thanks to a project tracker also built on the Agorand blockchain.',
