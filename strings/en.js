        'Terragrids is building a new concept for funding renewable energy projects at scale. Rather than relying on single individuals to foot the bill, Terragrids seeks to spread the financial investment across the globe. \nThe Terragrids platform provides an online gamified experience for Backers to invest as little as $10 to buy Non-Fungible Tokens on the energy-efficient Algorand blockchain and create sustainable towns in the Terragrids virtual world. \nRevenues from the sales of NFTs are transparently managed by Algorand Smart Contracts. In a single transaction, a small part of this money is used to sustain the business, a royalty is paid to the NFT illustrators, and most of the revenue is used to support the Creators to achive their project goals.',
